# osu!Profile
osu!Profile is a little program for helping you to see your progress in the ranking (if you're not very attentive and miss how many rank you've just passed when you finished a map), also allow you to export these data into files and importing them into your livestream with OBS or XSplit! Forked and changed the commands for total S-ranks and S-ranks difference to not be the same as total ranked score and ranked score difference. :D

## Features
- Shows your stats or these of any people
- Auto check your progress
- Choose the time interval between each update
- Auto check if new version is available
- You can export data shown in multiple files, many as you want
- Shows stats changes after each time you finished a game
